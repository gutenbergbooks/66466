alt="A" /></span>S we have invited the reader to a long Poem, we feel some misgiving in
setting before him a lengthy Preface. We will therefore bring to his
attention, as an Appendix, the matter intended as an Introduction, thus
leaving him free to begin with the Story of the <span class="smcap">Corsair</span> at once, while
the former may afterward be read with advantage, should he feel
interested in the facts and history of the locality of which it treats.
He will also find therein some particulars relating to the leading
characters described in the Story. There he will also learn why the
Pirate’s daughter became so impressed with fear as the vessel approached
the turbulent Strait, whose name, even now, is suggestive of wreck and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4">{4}</a></span>disaster.</p>

alt="H" /></span>ELL Gate, the scene of the tragedy described in the foregoing pages, is
not now what it was in former times. Its turbulent character has been
modified to such a degree that it has already lost half its terrors. The
mariner now, by skillful piloting, can avoid its dangers and bring his
ship safely from the jaws of this modern Charybdis. Not so in days
remote,&mdash;its numerous rocks, islands, shelves and whirlpools rendering
it terrible to the most skillful pilot at certain times of tide. This
long-desired change has been brought about by the Government, which has
expended millions of dollars in making this narrow strait leading to the
Sound less dangerous to the navigator. Though it has been the scene of
numerous tragedies, its history is not altogether uninteresting&mdash;and
first, as regards its name. There having been considerable controversy,
in times past, as to its correct orthography, we have taken some trouble
to investigate the matter. Some writers have insisted that it should be
spelt <i>Hurl</i> Gate. Ancient records, however, do not bear them out in
this respect. The map in Van der Donck’s History, published in 1656;
Ogilvie’s History of America, 1671, and also a journal written in the
sixteenth century, found in Hazard’s State Papers, give the name as
printed in the Poem. Besides these ancient and trustworthy authorities,
there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_24" id="page_24">{24}</a></span> venerable essay in French, which, speaking of various
changes made in names about New York, observes&mdash;“<i>De Helle-gat, trou
d’Enfer, ils ont fait Hell-Gate, Porte d’Enfer.</i>”</p>

<p>For aught we know the heroine of this strange legend, which the author
has sought to illustrate in verse, may have read the above passage in
French;&mdash;if so, her childish fear, after her father had spoken of their
close proximity to the fatal strait, was no more intense than we can
readily understand, when we take into account the superstitious age in
which the actors lived.</p>

<p>The perching of a raven upon the boom of the vessel, off the Azores,
contributed also to impress the Pirate’s daughter with evil forebodings.
Nor could she escape observing the consternation of the sailors who
beheld it fluttering over her father’s head, and overheard its dreadful
prophecy. This bird, as is well known, is exceedingly intelligent, and
can be taught to articulate words. It lives to a great age, a hundred
years or more, and from remote periods of history has been connected
with various popular superstitions. The Bible gives the first historical
notice of this species. We are told that at the end of forty days, after
the great flood had covered the earth, Noah, wishing to ascertain
whether or no the waters had abated, sent forth a raven, which did not
return into the ark. When Elijah provoked the enmity of Ahab, by
prophesying against him, and hid himself by the Brook Cherith, the
ravens were appointed by Heaven to bring him his daily food. Though thus
honored, this bird seems in all ages to have been considered ominous of
evil, and, in the days of auguries and divination, like the Banshee of
the Irish, was thought to possess the power of foretelling future
events&mdash;especially such as were dark, gloomy, and foreboding.</p>

<p>Perhaps no bird is more widely distributed over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_25" id="page_25">{25}</a></span> surface of the
globe. A British writer says, it “croaks as gravely as with ourselves on
the shores of the Black and Caspian Seas, visits our Indian metropolis
of Calcutta, forces it way over the guarded shores of Japan, dwells
among our busy descendants of America, ranges from Mount Etna to the
Iceland cold of Hecla, and braves the rigor of the Arctic regions as far
as Melville’s Island.” Dr. Richardson says that “it frequents the Barren
Grounds of the most intense winter cold, its movements being directed in
a great measure by those of the herds of reindeer, musk-oxen, and
bisons, which it follows, ready to assist in devouring such as are
killed by beasts of prey or by accident.” Captain Ross speaks of it as
“one of the few birds capable of braving the severity of an Arctic
winter.”</p>

<p>Although we have the pestering crow, with its unvarying “<i>Caw, caw,
caw!</i>” almost everywhere in our Eastern States, the raven is rarely seen
there, yet it is common in the West, and thence northward to the Fur
Countries. In this State it has its favorite haunts, one of which is the
region about Niagara Falls. Here, mingling its croakings with the roar
of waters, it seems still more solemn and mysterious than elsewhere.
Here one might read Poe’s “Raven,” which, by its spectral images,
produces a striking effect on the imagination, and feel the force of the
poet’s language as in no other locality:&mdash;</p>

<p>Sailors, it is well known, are very superstitious in regard to birds
alighting on their vessels. On such occasions they call them devil’s
birds, witches, etc. The appearance of stormy petrels at sea has been
supposed to portend rough weather, and they are therefore not welcome
visitors to sailors. These birds seem to delight in storm and tempest,
now sweeping down into the trough of the sea, and now soaring high up
among the clouds, and wheeling athwart them, as if enjoying a frolic.
They are said to haunt the whole Atlantic seaboard. Their habit of
paddling along the surface of the water obtained for them the name of
petrel, from the Apostle Peter, who walked upon the water. It is
probably to the birds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27">{27}</a></span> this species&mdash;the fearless riders of the
tempest&mdash;that Brainard refers in his song of “The Sea-Bird”:&mdash;</p>

<p>One word as to the Corsair’s nationality: Though not a historical fact,
the legend, meagre as it is, is explicit enough in regard to his having
been originally one of those bold Northmen who roamed the seas in the
sixteenth century, though at the opening of the foregoing story he had
his stronghold in some more salubrious climate than the North, probably
on one of the Grecian Isles. But his early years were doubtless spent in
quest of adventure in his native Norway seas. As in ages past, so even
now the Norwegian youth who lives near<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_28" id="page_28">{28}</a></span> the coast, takes to the sea,
though in legitimate pursuits, as naturally as his Berserker ancestors.
The Vikings of Norway were the boldest of all ancient mariners of a
piratical character. They looked upon the sea as their home;&mdash;the
tempest was their delight. The ship to them was as a living thing;&mdash;they
guided it with a spirit as exulting and confident as a rider does his
steed. “Blow where thou wilt, O wind,” they cried, “whithersoever thou
takest us, the land is ours!”</p>

<p>As regards the obstructions in Hell Gate, we have gathered a few facts
which may interest the reader. Though the sources are various, their
authenticity may be relied on. The East River, of which Hell Gate forms
a part, receives the tide at its two extremities; at the eastern
extremity, the Sound tide; at the western, the Sandy Hook tide. The
times as well as the heights of these tides are different. To make it
still more difficult for the mariner, there are three channels existing
at this historic place; that is, between the north point of Blackwell’s
Island and Negro Point on Ward’s Island. The eastern channel is six
hundred feet wide, and lies between the Astoria shore and the middle
reef, parts of which were formerly known as the Indian Flood Rock,
Chickens, and Negro Head; then we have the middle channel, between the
middle reef and the reef containing Great and Little Mill Rocks, and
finally the main ship channel, between the last reef and the New York
shore. Formerly, vessels bound eastward on the flood, taking the eastern
channel, in the endeavor to get around the reef at Hallet’s Point, ran
the risk of being carried upon the Frying Pan, near Ward’s Island, while
vessels bound westward on the ebb, were thrown so much off by the reef
at Hallet’s Point as to be endangered by the set of the tide directly
upon the middle reef. It was obvious, therefore, that the reef at
Hallet’s Point and the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_29" id="page_29">{29}</a></span> reef constituted the chief obstacles to
the safe passage of ships and other craft.</p>

<p>Besides these great barriers, many smaller rocks contributed to increase
the dangers awaiting the hapless mariner who boldly sought the waters of
the Sound at unpropitious times of tide and weather. More dangerous
because hidden, we give the names of a few of these formidable
obstructions: Pot Rock, situated in mid channel between Ward’s Island
and the Astoria shore, was a pyramidal rock, the depth over it being
about eighteen feet. Frying Pan had a depth of nine feet over it. Way’s
Reef and Shelldrake, situated in Pot Cove, had depths of water of five
and eight feet respectively. In the main channel there were two great
obstructions&mdash;the Heel Tap Rocks, north of Great Mill Rock, and Rylander
Reef, on the New York shore, near 92d street.</p>

<p>Old Dutch chronicles inform us that the unwieldy vessels from the
fatherland were sometimes drawn into the vortex of that tremendous
whirlpool called the Pot, where they were whirled about in giddy mazes
until the senses of their commanders and crews were overpowered by the
horror of the scene, and the strangeness of the revolution.</p>

<p>Certain it is, that to the horrific accounts of Dutch navigators may be
traced some of the various traditions handed down of this marvellous
Strait. It is also true that these ancient mariners gave this pass the
name of <i>Helle-gat</i>, or as it has been interpreted, Hell Gate.</p>

<p>For nearly half a century men have been blasting away at the jagged
reefs which jut out into the narrow channels which connect Long Island
Sound with the Bay of New York. For centuries ships have struck on these
same rocks. The average, in years lately passed, has been nearly one
vessel a week. Though many of the obstructions were cleared out by the
great explosion, planned and executed by Gen. John Newton, U.S.A.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30" id="page_30">{30}</a></span> some
ten years ago, yet the dangerous character of the strait remained. At
last, the Government decided to tunnel underneath the middle reef (Flood
Rock)&mdash;and at one tremendous explosion blow everything skyward. For
nearly a decade men worked night and day to accomplish that end. The
quantity of dynamite and powder used in charging the mine is said to
have been 275,000 pounds.</p>

<p>Great Mill Rock, lying midway in Hell Gate, almost opposite the
island-reef that has just been doomed to destruction, is supposed to
have been the Rock on which the Corsair’s daughter was thrown when her
father’s ship went down. The writer of these pages once knew a lady who,
in her youth, lived with her parents on this same island, her father at
that time being in the employ of the Government. This lady always seemed
delighted when telling any one how she had often carried convicts, who
had escaped from the prisons on Blackwell’s Island, in her skiff to the
main-land. Of course, such little frolics happened when she was young,
romantic, and&mdash;sympathetic. To make these feats of bravery appear more
daring, they were accomplished late at night.</p>

<p>There were nearly four miles of tunneling under Flood Rock, or about
21,670 feet. The longest galleries were four blocks in length, or 1,200
feet. If these galleries had been in a straight line their distance
would have been equal to a walk from the Battery to Forty-second street.
Twenty-four galleries or tunnels were run from north to south, which
were intersected by forty-six others, running nearly east and west. The
tunnels were on an average ten feet from floor to ceiling and six or
eight feet wide. The rock taken from them measured 80,000 cubic yards.
There were 467 huge pillars supporting the roof. All through these
galleries and corridors workmen had bored holes nine feet deep and three
inches in diameter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_31" id="page_31">{31}</a></span> The columns were also honey-combed with holes.
There were 13,286 of such holes, which were filled with dynamite and
powder cartridges. The chief engineer had only to touch an electric
button to explode all this destructive compound. Had one of those
unpleasant looking cartridges fallen from the hand of a workman upon the
rocky floor, and exploded, it would have ignited all the rest, and thus
caused a terrible disaster. Each cartridge weighed about six pounds.
They resembled rolling-pins in size, and were delivered at Flood Rock by
a tug-boat. They were received in square boxes, and, if they had been
placed in a line, they would have reached twenty-two miles. The previous
explosion at Hell Gate, directed by the same engineer, was effected with
50,000 pounds of rack-a-rock. During the charging of the mine at that
time the workmen dropped three cartridges. We have heard of but one
having been dropped at Flood Rock. Of course the greatest precaution was
exercised to prevent a catastrophe. Twenty picked miners had charge of
placing the cartridges in position. An elevator ran up and down the
shaft bringing explosives to the men below. The cartridges were hoisted
on cars and trundled away by mule power to the different corridors.</p>

<p>There was a weird, strange fascination about those dimly-lighted
caverns, and the visitor often stopped to admire the marvellous effect
of light on the great blocks of crystal quartz over which the clear
water rippled in brightness and splendor. A wooden bridge spanned a deep
ditch, which was so accurately laid out that it collected nearly all the
water that found its way into the tunnels. The pumps disposed of this at
the rate of 40,000 gallons per hour. The late explosion, it is asserted
by those familiar with the subject, was the greatest ever known in the
world. Now that the nine or ten acres of rock and island are blown up,
dredging machines<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32" id="page_32">{32}</a></span> will clear the channel, and dump the stone into
almost bottomless holes in the neighborhood. The mixing of such an
immense quantity of powder so near the city was done on Little Mill Rock
Island, under the careful supervision of Lieutenant Derby. The compound
was mixed in a lead-lined tank by men who used wooden hoes. It was then
poked from a trough into copper cylinders two and a half inches in
diameter and two feet long, and pressed down solid with wooden rammers.
Each cylinder when full was soldered so as to make it water-tight.</p>

<p>When compared to the great operations that have just terminated, those
of the past seem like child’s play. Maillefort’s process of discharging
cans filled with gunpowder was only useful in removing projecting points
of rock. It was entirely inadequate to cope with flat areas of rock, and
after three years&mdash;1851, 1852, and 1853&mdash;operations were suspended, with
no great results, while the hungry reefs and boiling floods claimed
their victims as before.</p>

<p>Though this work has cost much treasure, never was money better spent.
The scene of this great undertaking lies in the collection district of
New York, the nearest port of entry. The amount of revenue collected
during the year 1884, was, in round numbers, over $135,000,000. The
amount of commerce and navigation that will be benefitted by the
completion of this work daily is estimated at millions of dollars.</p>

<p>The cry&mdash;so familiar to those who ply the waters of the Sound&mdash;“Look out
for breakers!” will resound in this often-fatal locality no more&mdash;and
Flood Rock, with all its obstructions, it is hoped, has disappeared
forever beneath the green tide that swells through this once-turbulent
Strait.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
